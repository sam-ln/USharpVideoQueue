## Installation

**USharpVideoQueue** can be installed using two different methods.

### Method 1: VRChat Creator Companion (recommended)

It's recommended to use the [VRChat Creator Companion (VCC)](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/) to install this package.
To do so, visit my VPM Repository below and click "***Add to VCC***" and add the `com.arcanescripts.usharpvideoqueue`package to your project.

If you choose this method, you need to use the USharpVideo version provided in my repository. It will be automatically installed as a dependency.

####  [ðŸ“¥ My VRChat Creator Companion Repository](https://sam-ln.github.io/vpm/)

### Method 2: Install manually using the .unitypackage file
This method will not use the VCC and should be used if you already have a non-VCC version of USharpVideo installed in your project
and you do not want to replace it. This version does not include Assembly Definitions (.asmdef files).
#### Requirements

- Latest version of VRChat SDK and UdonSharp (installed via [Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/))
- One version of USharpVideo must be installed. USharpVideoQueue supports these versions:
    - [USharpVideo, a fork by sam-ln (recommended)](https://github.com/sam-ln/USharpVideo)
    - [USharpVideoModernUI, a fork by DrBlackRat](https://github.com/DrBlackRat/USharpVideoModernUI) 
    - [USharpVideo by MerlinVR](https://github.com/MerlinVR/USharpVideo/)

## Setup in your project
- Depending on your install method, locate USharpVideoQueue in *Packages* or *Assets*
- Drag USharpVideoQueue prefab into your Unity scene
- Open up the Queue in your Inspector window and drag your USharpVideoPlayer into the field "Video Player"

## Integration

This section is only relevant if you want to integrate this queue with your own U# scripts.

### Events

You can react to any events emitted by the Queue by registering as a callback listener in your own U# Behaviour
and implementing a receiving method:

```c# 
using UdonSharp;
using UnityEngine;
using USharpVideoQueue.Runtime;

public class YourBehaviour : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    public VideoQueue VideoQueue;
    
    void Start()
    {
        VideoQueue.RegisterCallbackReceiver(this);
    }

    public void OnUSharpVideoQueueContentChange()
    {
        Debug.Log("Received ContentChangeEvent!");
    }
}
 ```
